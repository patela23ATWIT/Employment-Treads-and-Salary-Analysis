# Employment-Treads-and-Salary-Analysis
Exploring employment and salary trends of the dataset, while examining years of experience, education levels, and job titles.

## Introduction

This project aims to reveal meaningful insights into employment trends and salary dynamics by analyzing the dataset. The focus is on exploring how age, gender, education, and job title all affect salary. Aiming to find trends and potential disparities in compensation within the workforce.

The project utilizes the data science tools NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation. Along with Scikit-learn, it helps to provide predictive modeling, enabling us to form predictions from the dataset.

### Key Questions

1. Are there significant gender-based variations in compensation?
2. What trends exist between education levels concerning salary?
3. Are there any notable disparities in compensation across the various factors?

By addressing these questions, the project aims to contribute insight into the dynamics of employment and compensation, allowing a deeper understanding of the factors that may influence salary.
